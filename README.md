# Digital Image Processing

### This is all practical exercises of the Digital Image Processing class at DUT
- Programs in the [notebook](https://github.com) folder. It's like a notebook with code
- Images in the [Image](https://github.com) folder
- Final-term and Mid-term are references for your exam. They aren't right perfectly, so just reference.
